```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load libraries

```{r , echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Problem 1 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
data1 = tibble(
  a = rnorm(10, sd = .5))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
